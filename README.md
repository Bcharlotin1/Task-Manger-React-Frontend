### About

This is a Task Manager React App where users can signup/log in,create projects and tasks.

This app uses Ruby on Rails for the backend. So this. Repo is dependent on another. 
Must Fork and Clone [Task Manager API](https://github.com/Bcharlotin1/Task-Manager-API)

### How To Use
This app runs on *http://localhost:3001/*. This is so that It will not conflict with the rails backend that runs on http://localhost:3000/",  which needs to run simultaneously.

1. Fork and Clone  Rails API [Task Manager API](https://github.com/Bcharlotin1/Task-Manager-API)
2. Fork and Cone this Repo "Task-Manger-React-Frontend"
3. Make sure the rails API is running, then Run `yarn start` in your terminal




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
